## [0.2.4] — 2026-05-16

### Security

- **SEC-CRIT-03 — IPv6 ULA / link-local addresses bypassed SSRF guard** (`src/feeds/mod.rs`)  
  `is_private_ip()` only covered `::1` and `::`. ULA (`fc00::/7`), link-local (`fe80::/10`),
  IPv4-mapped (`::ffff:0:0/96`), and NAT64 well-known (`100::/64`) ranges were not blocked.
  A feed hostname resolving to `fd00::1` or `fe80::1` bypassed the SSRF check entirely.
  All IPv6 private/internal ranges are now covered.

- **SEC-CRIT-04 — SSRF redirect policy only inspected literal IP destinations** (`src/feeds/mod.rs`)  
  A feed server could redirect to `http://internal.corp/data` and the redirect would be
  followed without any hostname validation. The redirect policy now blocks redirects to
  well-known internal hostnames (`.local`, `.internal`, `.corp`, `.lan`, `localhost`,
  `169.254.169.254`, `metadata.google.internal`).

- **SEC-HIGH-01 — No feed subscription count limit** (`src/api/mod.rs`)  
  An authenticated client could add unlimited feeds. Since each feed can download up to
  100 MiB, this enabled an authenticated DoS via memory/disk exhaustion.
  Hard cap `MAX_FEEDS = 100` is now enforced on `POST /feeds`.

- **SEC-HIGH-03 — Silent fallback to Cloudflare when no forward-zone configured** (`src/dns/server.rs`)  
  Misconfigured or stripped config files caused all queries to be silently routed to
  Cloudflare. A `WARN`-level log is now emitted to alert operators.

- **SEC-MED-04 — XDP frame_mut() had no bounds assertion** (`src/dns/xdp/umem.rs`)  
  A malformed XDP ring descriptor could produce an out-of-bounds write in the XDP fast path.
  `debug_assert!` bounds checks added to `frame_mut()` and `frame()`.

- **SEC-MED-07 — api-key in config file accepted silently** (`src/config/parser.rs`)  
  Using `api-key:` in `runbound.conf` stores the token in cleartext. A `WARN`-level log
  is now emitted directing operators to use `RUNBOUND_API_KEY` in the env file instead.

### Fixed

- **API docs: ghost endpoints removed** (`docs/api.md`)  
  `GET /health`, `GET /stats`, `GET /config`, and `POST /reload` were documented as
  implemented but returned HTTP 404. The docs now accurately reflect the implemented
  endpoints and note the missing ones as open work items.

- **API docs: path parameters corrected** (`docs/api.md`)  
  `DELETE /dns/{name}` and `DELETE /feeds/{name}` used name-based paths in the docs
  but the actual implementation uses UUID (`DELETE /dns/:id`, `DELETE /feeds/:id`).
  `POST /feeds/{name}/refresh` → `POST /feeds/:id/update`. All corrected.

- **systemd.md: SIGHUP table: ACL is NOT reloaded** (`docs/systemd.md`)  
  The hot-reload table incorrectly stated that `access-control` rules are reloaded on
  SIGHUP. The `Arc<Acl>` is built once at startup; only local zones, DNS entries,
  blacklist, and feed entries are reloaded. ACL changes require a full restart.

### Added

- **`docs/security-audit.md`** — Full white-box security audit (23 findings, CRIT→LOW).

---

## [0.2.3] — 2026-05-16

### Fixed

- **`/etc/guestdns/` → `/etc/runbound/`** (`src/feeds/mod.rs`, `src/main.rs`)  
  Feed subscriptions and cache were stored in `/etc/guestdns/feeds.json` and
  `/etc/guestdns/feed_cache/` — a leftover path from the project's internal predecessor.
  All paths are now under `/etc/runbound/`, consistent with every other Runbound data file.
  The `--help` text is also corrected.

- **SIGHUP now hot-reloads zones instead of killing the process** (`src/main.rs`)  
  `systemctl reload runbound` previously terminated the DNS server because SIGHUP had no
  handler and the OS default action (terminate) fired. A `tokio::signal::unix` handler is
  now installed at startup: on SIGHUP, the config file is re-parsed and all local zones,
  persisted DNS entries, blacklist, and feed entries are rebuilt atomically via ArcSwap.
  In-flight DNS queries are not interrupted. `ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID` in the
  systemd unit file now works correctly.

- **OISD Full preset URL returned HTTP 410 Gone** (`src/feeds/mod.rs`)  
  `https://dbl.oisd.nl/` was deprecated upstream. Updated to `https://big.oisd.nl/`
  (domains format). OISD Basic updated from `https://dbl.oisd.nl/basic/` to
  `https://small.oisd.nl/` (domains format).

- **Local CNAME chain not followed** (`src/dns/server.rs`)  
  A query for `alias.local A` where `alias.local CNAME tardis.local` and
  `tardis.local A 192.168.1.1` were both local-data entries returned an empty answer.
  RFC 1034 §3.6.2 requires the resolver to follow the chain and include all records.
  `follow_local_cname()` now walks up to 8 hops within local zones and returns the
  full CNAME chain + final A/AAAA records in one response.

- **Download URLs in docs were unversioned** (`README.md`, `docs/unbound-migration.md`)  
  Links pointed to `runbound-x86_64-linux-musl` but release assets are named
  `runbound-vX.Y.Z-x86_64-linux-musl`. Following the doc URL caused a 404.
  All references now include the version prefix and note to check the releases page.

- **`/health` documented as public — actually requires Bearer token** (`docs/api.md`)  
  The API reference incorrectly stated "No authentication required" for `GET /health`.
  The endpoint enforces the same auth as all others. Doc corrected.

- **`install.sh` required a local Rust build** (`install.sh`)  
  The installer checked for `./target/release/runbound` and failed for users without
  a Rust toolchain. Rewritten to auto-detect architecture, fetch the versioned binary
  from the GitHub release, verify it with `--version`, and write the systemd unit inline.
  Supports `--version <tag>` for pinned installs. `--uninstall` still works.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-05-16

### Added

- **`api-port` directive** (`src/config/parser.rs`, `src/main.rs`)  
  The REST API port is now configurable via the config file (`api-port: 9090`).
  Defaults to `8081` when absent. Removes the hardcoded `API_PORT` constant.

- **`cache-max-ttl` directive** (`src/config/parser.rs`, `src/dns/server.rs`)  
  Maximum TTL cap for cached records is now configurable (`cache-max-ttl: 3600`).
  Defaults to `86400` (24 h) when absent. Removes the hardcoded `MAX_TTL_CAP` constant.
  Mirrors Unbound's `cache-max-ttl` directive.

- **`private-address` directive — DNS rebinding protection** (`src/config/parser.rs`, `src/dns/acl.rs`, `src/dns/server.rs`)  
  CIDR ranges configured with `private-address` are now enforced: if any A or AAAA record
  returned by an upstream resolver falls within a configured private range, the query is
  answered with SERVFAIL instead of forwarding the private IP to the client.
  Mirrors Unbound's `private-address` directive. A new `PrivateAddressSet` type in
  `acl.rs` provides zero-extra-crate CIDR matching using the same bit-shift/mask logic
  as the ACL engine. `CidrBlock` is factored out to avoid code duplication.

- **`forward-tls-upstream` directive — DNS-over-TLS to upstream** (`src/config/parser.rs`, `src/dns/server.rs`)  
  Adding `forward-tls-upstream: yes` to a `forward-zone:` block now sends queries to
  upstream resolvers over an encrypted TLS connection (port 853 by default, overridable
  with `addr@port` syntax). Without the directive, plain UDP+TCP is used (existing behaviour).
  Mirrors Unbound's `forward-tls-upstream` directive.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-05-16

### Performance

- **OPT-01 — Eliminate `Name::from(qname.clone())` on every DNS query** (`src/dns/local.rs`, `src/dns/server.rs`)
  `LocalZoneSet::find()`, `local_records()`, and `name_has_records()` now accept `&LowerName`
  directly instead of `&Name`. Previously, every incoming query paid two heap allocations
  (clone `LowerName` + `Name::from`) before the first zone lookup. The hot path now uses
  `LowerName: Borrow<Name>` to perform the `HashMap` lookup with zero allocation.
  The walk-up hierarchy path (`find()` parent-zone traversal) uses `LowerName::base_name()`
  end-to-end, avoiding an additional `Name` clone per label trimmed.
  The XDP fast path benefits from the same change with no callsite modification.

### Fixed

- **`*response_code` in resolver error path** (`src/dns/server.rs`)
  `ResolveErrorKind::NoRecordsFound::response_code` binds as `&ResponseCode` under match
  ergonomics. The dereference was correct but the compiler's error reporting was misleading
  when other errors were present in the same compilation unit. Confirmed and preserved as-is.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-16

### Security

- **SEC-01 — Race condition on concurrent API writes** (`src/api/mod.rs`)  
  `store::load` / `store::save` are now performed inside the `zones_mutex` critical section, making the entire read→validate→write→swap sequence atomic. Previously two concurrent `POST /dns` requests could both read the same snapshot and one silently overwrite the other.

- **SEC-02 — XDP fast-path bypassed ACL entirely** (`src/dns/xdp/worker.rs`)  
  The AF_XDP worker answered DNS queries without consulting the ACL. An attacker on a refused subnet could bypass the access-control policy by sending raw UDP on an XDP-attached interface. ACL is now checked in `answer_dns()` before any zone lookup; `Deny` → silent drop, `Refuse` → crafts a REFUSED DNS frame.

- **SEC-03 — IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses skipped ACL rules** (`src/dns/acl.rs`)  
  A client connecting over IPv6 with address `::ffff:10.0.0.1` would not match the IPv4 `10.0.0.0/8` allow entry and would fall through to the default `Refuse`. Address normalisation now maps `::ffff:a.b.c.d` → `a.b.c.d` before matching, ensuring consistent ACL behaviour across transports.

- **SEC-04 — SSRF via HTTP redirect** (`src/feeds/mod.rs`)  
  `reqwest` follows redirects by default. A malicious feed server could redirect to `http://169.254.169.254/` (cloud metadata) or any private IP. A custom redirect `Policy` now blocks HTTPS→HTTP downgrades and redirects whose destination resolves to a private or loopback address.

- **SEC-05 — TOCTOU on feed URL validation** (`src/feeds/mod.rs`)  
  Feed URLs were validated once at subscription time; subsequent `update_feed()` calls reused the stored URL without re-checking. A race between subscribe and first fetch, or a compromised feed record, could bypass validation. `update_feed()` now re-validates the URL on every invocation.

- **SEC-06 — Unbounded data-store growth** (`src/api/mod.rs`)  
  No limit was enforced on the number of DNS entries or blacklist entries. An authenticated client could fill disk / exhaust memory. Limits are now enforced: `MAX_DNS_ENTRIES = 10 000`, `MAX_BLACKLIST_ENTRIES = 100 000`; `POST` requests beyond the limit return `422 Unprocessable Entity`.

- **SEC-07 — Feed data files world-readable** (`src/feeds/mod.rs`)  
  Serialised feed files were created with the process umask (typically `0644`). Feeds may contain sensitive block-list intelligence. A `chmod 640` is now applied after each atomic rename so files are readable only by owner and group.

- **SEC-08 — Plaintext HTTP feeds** (`src/feeds/mod.rs`)  
  HTTP feed URLs were silently accepted. A `WARN`-level log is now emitted for any `http://` feed URL, flagging the man-in-the-middle injection risk.

### Changed

- ACL logic extracted into a dedicated `src/dns/acl.rs` module with a public `Acl` / `AclAction` API, shared by both the hickory-server path and the XDP worker.
- `run_dns_server()` and `start_xdp()` now accept an `Arc<Acl>` built once in `main()` and shared across all paths.
- Version bumped to `0.2.0` in `Cargo.toml`.

### Added

- `examples/home.conf` — Home / Pi-hole replacement configuration.
- `examples/office.conf` — SMB office split-horizon DNS configuration.
- `examples/server.conf` — Public/shared recursive resolver configuration.
- `examples/secure.conf` — High-security / air-gapped / military-grade configuration.
- `README.md` — Comprehensive GitHub documentation: installation, configuration reference, full REST API reference, performance benchmarks, security architecture, systemd setup, XDP fast-path guide, Unbound compatibility table, and sysadmin-oriented comparison.
- `.gitignore` — Comprehensive ignore rules covering build artefacts, PGO data, TLS secrets, editor files, and test artefacts.
